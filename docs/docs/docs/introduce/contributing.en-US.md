# Contributing

❤️ Loving Umi and want to get involved? Thanks!

## Environment Setup

### Node.js and pnpm

Developing Umi requires Node.js 16+ and `pnpm` v8.

It is recommended to use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions to avoid permission issues and easily switch between Node.js versions. Windows developers can use [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Install `pnpm` via one of the methods on its [official website](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Clone the Project

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:umijs/umi.git
$ cd umi
```

### Install Dependencies and Build

```bash
$ pnpm i && pnpm build
```

## Developing Umi

### Start the dev Command

A must-run command for local development of Umi, for compiling TypeScript files in the `src` directory to the `dist` directory, and incrementally compiles on file changes.

```bash
$ pnpm dev
```

If you find it rather slow, you can also run the `pnpm dev` command for a specific package, for example.

```bash
$ cd packages/umi
$ pnpm dev
```

### Run Example

The `examples` directory contains various examples used for testing. Running an example is a common way to ensure functions work correctly during Umi development. Each example is equipped with a dev script, so just enter the example and run `pnpm dev`.

```bash
$ cd examples/boilerplate
$ pnpm dev
```

To run in vite mode, add the `--vite` argument,

```bash
$ pnpm dev --vite
```

### Testing

Currently running tests is fast, completing in just over 10s+. It’s recommended to run tests locally before submitting a PR to reduce Round Trips.

```bash
$ pnpm test
...
Test Suites: 1 skipped, 43 passed, 43 of 44 total
Tests:       6 skipped, 167 passed, 173 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        13.658 s
Ran all test suites.
```

To run tests for specific files, use `pnpm jest` because `pnpm test` runs with turborepo enabled.

For example,

```bash
$ pnpm jest packages/plugin-docs/src/compiler.test.ts
```

## Contributing to Umi Documentation

Umi's documentation is implemented by Umi@4 and the `@umijs/plugin-docs` plugin, essentially an Umi project. Execute the following commands in the root directory to start development:

```bash
# Install Umi document dependencies
$ pnpm doc:deps
# Start Umi document development
# Compilation takes longer on first launch, please be patient
$ pnpm doc:dev
```

Open the specified port number to see real-time updates of documentation and results of the `@umijs/plugin-docs` plugin development.

### Writing Umi Documentation

Umi documentation is written in MDX format. MDX is an extension of the Markdown format allowing you to insert JSX components while writing Umi documentation.

:::success{title=🏆︎}
When writing **Documentation**, you can find usable components in `packages/plugin-docs/client/theme-doc/components`. When writing **Blog posts**, usable components can be found in `packages/plugin-docs/client/theme-blog/components`.
:::

Umi documentation code highlighting is based on [`Rehype Pretty Code`](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code), for full capabilities and instructions, please visit its [official documentation](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app).

Execute the following command in the root directory to format existing Umi documentation:

```bash
$ pnpm format:docs
```

After formatting the documentation, it is recommended to **only submit the Umi documents you have written or modified**. Different document contributors have varying writing styles and formatting may not always retain the original intended style.

### Participating in Umi Documentation Plugin Development

Open a new terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
$ cd packages/plugin-docs
$ pnpm dev:css
```

Now, when you modify the `tailwind.css` file or TailwindCSS style classes during development, a `tailwind.out.css` stylesheet file will be automatically compiled and generated.

Umi listens for changes in the `docs` and `packages/plugin-docs/client` directories, but does not listen to changes in `packages/plugin-docs/src`.

:::info{title=💡}
If you need to compile files in `packages/plugin-docs/src`, please move to the `packages/plugin-docs` directory and execute the `pnpm build` command, then restart development.
:::

Executing the following command in the root directory to format the code of Umi documentation plugin:

```bash
$ pnpm format:plugin-docs
```

Execute the following command in the root directory to build Umi documentation:

```bash
$ pnpm doc:build
```

## Adding a New Package

Adding a new package has a script encapsulated, no need to manually copy `package.json`, etc.:

```bash
# Create package directory
$ mkdir packages/foo
# Initialize package development
$ pnpm bootstrap
```

## Updating Dependencies

> It is not recommended for non-Core Maintainers to update a large number of dependencies because it involves pre-packaging of dependencies and there are many points to note.

Run `pnpm dep:update` to update dependencies.

```bash
$ pnpm dep:update
```

Since Umi pre-packages some dependencies, after updating dependencies, it's necessary to check if the updated dependency is in devDependencies and whether it has been pre-packaged. If so, execute `pnpm build:deps` in the corresponding package and specify the dependency to update pre-packaged dependency files.

```bash
$ pnpm build:deps --dep webpack-manifest-plugin
```

## Release

Only Core Maintainers can carry out releases.

```bash
$ pnpm release
```

## Rolling Back through dist-tag

For example, to roll back to 4.0.81.

```bash
$ pnpm -rc --filter "./packages/**" exec pnpm dist-tag add \$PNPM_PACKAGE_NAME@4.0.81 latest
```
