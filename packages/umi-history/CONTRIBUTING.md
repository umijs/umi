All development happens on GitHub. When [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), please make sure that all of the following apply:

- If you're adding a new feature or "fixing" a bug, please go into detail about your use case and why you think you need that feature or that bug fixed. This library has lots and lots of dependents, and we can't afford to make changes lightly without understanding why.
- The tests pass. The test suite will automatically run when you create the PR. All you need to do is wait a few minutes to see the result in the PR.
- Each commit in your PR should describe a significant piece of work. Work that was done in one commit and then undone later should be squashed into a single commit.

Also, please make sure the CHANGES.md document contains a short note about the nature of your change. Just follow the format of the existing entries in that document. If the most recent entry is a release, please start a new section under a `## HEAD` heading.

If your PR fails to meet these guidelines, it may be closed without much of an explanation besides a link to this document.

Thank you for your contribution!
